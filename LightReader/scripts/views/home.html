            <h2>Chapter 1 『To this 《Shield》———』</h2>

            <h3>Part 1</h3>

            <p>This was a special Sunday.</p>

            <p>“Listen, Index. Use this money carefully.”</p>

            <p>The boy named Kamijou Touma placed an envelope of money in her hands.</p>

            <p>
                “This money came from all the puzzles you solved on that reward site. You solved so
                many so fast using my account that I’m a little afraid some counterintelligence people
                are going to be watching me, but this money definitely belongs to you. You can buy
                whatever you want with it and you don’t have to buy anything you don’t want. Think
                carefully about whether you want to save it or use it and make sure you don’t regret your
                decision.”
            </p>

            <p>And then…</p>

            <p>
                “Wahah! With this, I can eat ramen and tempura and pancakes and yakiniku and sushi
                and curry and Salisbury steak and gyudon and shabu-shabu and Chinese dumplings and
                Peking duck and sukiyaki and roast beef and fried chicken and oden!!”
            </p>

            <p>“What did I just say!?”</p>

            <p>
                Index slipped past the pointy-haired boy who was feeling faint and she ran from the
                student dorm with the calico cat.
            </p>

            <p>However, she had not left in order to eat takoyaki with her dinner or anything like that.</p>

            <p>“I’m gonna buy Touma a present. What should I get, Sphinx?”</p>

            <p>
                Index seemed like the type who would simply get lost somewhere nearby, but she had a
                perfect memory. As long as she did not panic and then have trouble accessing her
                memories, visiting the shopping district near the station was simple.
            </p>

            <p>But then…</p>

            <p>“?”</p>

            <p>
                She suddenly came to a stop.
                Two girls wearing Tokiwadai Middle School’s winter uniform left a combination store
                that was not quite a bookshop, not quite a CD shop, not quite a rental shop, and not
                quite a game shop.
            </p>

            <p>“That’s strange. Kuroko, didn’t this place used to have Monday releases a day early?”</p>
